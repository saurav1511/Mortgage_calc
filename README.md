## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This tool was created using HTML, CSS, and JS. In JS we used DOM to manipulate elements. 

Challenges faced while doing this project. 

1) Creating separate layouts for desktop and mobile.
2) Logic building to take the inputs for every screen type.
